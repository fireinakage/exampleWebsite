## Ripple effect for buttons

To enable the ripple effect on a button or any clickable element, add the class `ripple` to it and make sure `styles.css` and `main.js` are included in your page (they already are in `index.html`).

Example:

<button class="ripple">Click me</button>

The ripple JavaScript will create a temporary animated element and remove it automatically after the animation.
